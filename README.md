 Here’s a simplified explanation of the Solidity smart contract:

### Overview:
This contract represents a hotel room that people can book by paying a certain amount of Ether (cryptocurrency). It checks if the room is available and if the user sends enough Ether. If both conditions are met, the user can book the room, and the Ether is sent to the owner of the hotel room.

### Breakdown of the Code:

1. **License Declaration (`SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT`)**:
   - This specifies the license under which the code is shared. It's a standard practice.

2. **Solidity Version (`pragma solidity ^0.8.25`)**:
   - The contract uses Solidity version 0.8.25 or newer.

3. **Contract Name (`HotelRoom`)**:
   - The name of the contract is `HotelRoom`, meaning it manages a single room.

4. **Enum `Statuses`**:
   - The `Statuses` enum defines two possible states for the room:
     - `Vacant` (empty, available for booking)
     - `Occupied` (someone has already booked it)
   - The contract stores the current status of the room in `currentStatus` and makes it publicly viewable.

5. **Event `Occupy`**:
   - An event is used to log important actions. Here, it logs when someone books the room, capturing the user's address and the amount of Ether they sent.

6. **Owner**:
   - The `owner` is the person who deployed the contract (usually the hotel owner). The `address payable` type means the owner can receive Ether payments.

7. **Constructor**:
   - The constructor is run once when the contract is first deployed. It sets the `owner` to be the person who deployed the contract and makes the room available (`Vacant`).

8. **Modifier `onlyWhileVacant`**:
   - This modifier ensures that the room can only be booked if it is currently vacant. If the room is occupied, it will throw an error and prevent the function from proceeding.

9. **Modifier `checkPrice(uint _amount)`**:
   - This modifier ensures that the person trying to book sends at least a minimum amount of Ether (in this case, `2 ether`). If they send less, it will throw an error and stop the transaction.

10. **Function `book()`**:
    - This is the main function that lets someone book the room.
    - **`payable`**: This keyword means the function can accept Ether.
    - **Checks**: Before booking, it checks if the room is vacant (using the `onlyWhileVacant` modifier) and if enough Ether was sent (using `checkPrice(2 ether)`).
    - **Room Status Update**: It marks the room as occupied.
    - **Payment Transfer**: It transfers the Ether to the owner’s address using `owner.call{value: msg.value}("")`.
      - The `call` function returns two values:
        - `sent`: whether the payment was successful.
        - `data`: additional transaction data (not used here).
      - The `require(true)` should probably be `require(sent)` to ensure the payment was successful.
    - **Event Emission**: It emits the `Occupy` event to log that the room was booked by a specific user with the amount they paid.

### Summary:
- This contract allows someone to book a hotel room if it's available by paying at least 2 Ether.
- It checks the room's availability and the amount paid, updates the status, and transfers the payment to the owner.
- The booking action is logged using an event (`Occupy`).
